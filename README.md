# Employee_app
It is an application created with c++ that helps to store employees' data and also calculate their pay.
Of course, let's explain the code without demonstrating it:

1. **Constants**: 
   - `MAX_EMPLOYEES`: Defines the maximum number of employees the system can handle.
   - `SALARY_BASE`: Defines the base salary for all employees.
   - `BONUS_RATE`: Defines the bonus rate.

2. **Employee struct**:
   - `Employee`: A structure containing three fields: `name` (string), `id` (integer), and `salary` (integer).

3. **Function prototypes**:
   - `addEmployee`: Adds a new employee to the system.
   - `viewEmployees`: Displays details of all employees in the system.
   - `calculateTotalPay`: Calculates the total pay (salary + bonus) for each employee.

4. **Main function**:
   - Declares variables, including an array of `Employee` structures and a counter for the number of employees.
   - Displays a menu of options for the user.
   - Reads the user's choice and executes corresponding actions using a switch statement.
   - The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

5. **Function definitions**:
   - `addEmployee`: Prompts the user to input employee details, assigns a base salary, and increments the number of employees.
   - `viewEmployees`: Displays details of all employees stored in the array.
   - `calculateTotalPay`: Calculates the total pay (salary + bonus) for each employee and displays it.

These functions operate on the array of `Employee` structures to manage employee data and perform necessary operations. The program's functionality revolves around the user interface provided by the menu in the main function.


Title: Deleting Employee Records in C++

In the realm of employee management systems developed using C++, the process of deleting an employee's records is a crucial operation that demands precision and care. When an employee leaves the organization or their records are deemed obsolete, it becomes imperative to remove their data from the system efficiently. Here, we delve into the intricacies of how this can be accomplished using C++.

One of the fundamental aspects of programming in C++ is memory management. When creating an employee record, memory allocation plays a pivotal role. Therefore, when it comes to deleting an employee's records, deallocating the memory associated with those records is paramount to prevent memory leaks and optimize system performance.

The deletion process typically involves several steps:

Identifying the Employee: Before initiating the deletion process, the system must identify the employee whose records are to be deleted. This identification can be based on unique identifiers such as employee ID, name, or any other distinguishing factor.

Locating the Record: Once the employee is identified, the system must locate their record within the data structure used for storage. Whether the records are stored in an array, linked list, database, or any other data structure, efficient traversal methods are employed to pinpoint the exact location of the employee's data.

Deleting the Record: With the employee's record located, the deletion operation is executed. This involves removing the record from the data structure and releasing the memory allocated to store that record. In C++, this is typically done using the delete keyword to deallocate memory allocated with new.

Adjusting Data Structure: Depending on the data structure used, it may be necessary to adjust the structure after deleting the employee's record. For example, if records are stored in an array or a linked list, removing one record may require shifting or rearranging subsequent records to maintain data integrity.

Confirmation and Logging: After the deletion is completed, it's essential to provide confirmation to the user that the operation was successful. Additionally, logging the deletion event with relevant details such as the employee's ID, name, and timestamp can be beneficial for auditing purposes.

Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle exceptional cases, such as attempting to delete a nonexistent record or encountering errors during memory deallocation.
